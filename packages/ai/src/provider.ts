 * an unavailable request selection, an adapter that threw, an adapter that simply stopped — leaves here as an
 * `error` event.
 *
 * The sequence is `sent` first and one terminal event last. `sent` is emitted before the first adapter event is
 * forwarded, so a turn is always attributable to a model and a contract even if the wire never
 * answered; and once `done` or `error` has been forwarded nothing further is passed on, so an
