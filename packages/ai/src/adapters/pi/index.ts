/**
 * DEPLOYMENT NOTES — read these before deploying a route table, and carry them into the delivery
 * notes for any deployment that upgrades onto this adapter.
 *
 * 1. ON BEDROCK, THE ENVIRONMENT STILL DECIDES THE DESTINATION. THIS IS OPEN, NOT CLOSED, AND IT IS
 *    THE ORDINARY PRODUCTION CONFIGURATION RATHER THAN AN EXOTIC ONE.
 *
 *    `bedrock-converse-stream` pins the request to the declared base URL only for a host that is not
 *    a standard Bedrock one. For `bedrock-runtime[-fips].<region>.amazonaws.com[.cn]` — the only
 *    host a deployment that is not fronting Bedrock with its own gateway has — the library pins the
 *    endpoint only when no region and no profile are configured, and AWS_REGION is set by default on
 *    EC2, ECS, Lambda and EKS. So in the majority deployment the declared endpoint is advisory and
 *    the bound credential goes wherever the environment points it. It cannot be closed from inside
 *    this package: passing a region is itself one of the two things that turns the pinning off, no
 *    option on the library's surface sets the endpoint unconditionally, and writing a process-wide
 *    AWS variable from here would restore the environment dependency this adapter exists to remove.
 *
 *    So it is owed by whatever assembles the process this adapter runs in. Two roles, both needed —
 *    clearing only the second leaves the first free to re-point the region:
 *
 *      (a) stop the library from unpinning, by ensuring none of these is set (or setting them to the
 *          declared route's own region): AWS_REGION, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, AWS_PROFILE.
 *      (b) once unpinned, the AWS SDK resolves the destination itself, from:
 *          AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME (service-specific, consulted first),
 *          AWS_ENDPOINT_URL (global fallback),
 *          AWS_CONFIG_FILE and AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE (the same setting reached through the
 *          profile, as `endpoint_url` or `services.bedrock_runtime.endpoint_url` — so an env-only
 *          sweep is incomplete, since ~/.aws/config reaches it on the default path),
 *          AWS_USE_FIPS_ENDPOINT and AWS_USE_DUALSTACK_ENDPOINT (which host family is resolved),
 *          and AWS_REGION / AWS_DEFAULT_REGION again in their second role, because the host is
 *          rebuilt out of `config.region` — a route declaring `us-east-1` can be answered by
 *          `eu-west-1` with no endpoint variable set at all.
 *
 *    The single strongest lever is to SET AWS_IGNORE_CONFIGURED_ENDPOINT_URLS=true, which is the
 *    SDK's own opt-out; the region and profile clearing is second.
 *
 * 2. TWO BEHAVIOUR CHANGES A DEPLOYMENT CAN NOTICE.
 *
 *    AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME_MAP is no longer honoured. It chose which model answered and what
 *    was billed, from the environment; the deployment name is now pinned to the model the request
 *    named. A deployment that renamed a model through that map states the name in its catalogue
 *    record instead, where the rest of the route table can see it.
 *
 *    A Vertex base URL holding `{location}` is refused at assembly rather than resolved. The library
 *    discards such a base URL and rebuilds the destination out of GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION, which is a
 *    Google public endpoint the route never named, so the refusal is the point. A route table copied
 *    from a vendor catalogue with the path left templated hits this; the error names the route and
 *    the reason, and the fix is to write the location into the URL.
 *
 * 3. AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION is still read from the environment. It is not a destination — the host
 *    stays the declared one — but it shapes the request as `?api-version=`, so which version a
 *    deployment talks is chosen by its environment and not by its route table. Registered, not
 *    fixed.

/**
 * A route has to say where it points before it may stream. The schema only bounds the length of the

 * reads an absent base URL as "use the vendor's default", which turns a route that declared no
 * endpoint into a request to a vendor's production API carrying the deployment's own credential.
 * Rejecting it at assembly makes that a startup failure instead of a silent egress.
 *
 * The value is not echoed. A base URL is a plausible place for a token to be hidden, and this
 * message is going to be logged.
 *
 * Half of this belongs in the schema — a minimum length and an absolute-http format, so a malformed
 * route table is refused at the door where the error can name the field while the operator is still
 * holding the file. That is owed at the next change to the declaration, along with the question this
 * function cannot answer: whether a route may state that its endpoint is final. This check stays
 * either way, because a route is also built programmatically and never meets the schema.

 * as well, because there it does not describe a request without a credential.
