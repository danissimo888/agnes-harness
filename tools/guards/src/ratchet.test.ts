  // 2026-09-14: project/ui.ts routes a user/message tagged data.kind==='runtime_context' to a new

  // (archived implementation record) — createJitiPackageLoader, the real
  // PackageLoader that resolves a package's entry from package.json (exports['.'] / string
  // exports / main, defaulting to ./index.js) and hands it to readNamedExports. This is still
  // Step 7 of the same sequence the note above already accounts for, not the package-trust /
  // lockfile verification (Step 8) the note warns to split out instead — Step 8 remains blocked
  // (needs the `Lockfile` type from the unmerged feat/host-lockfile branch) and out of scope here.
  // Measured total: 639; 650 leaves a little room without inviting scope creep back in.
  //
  // 2026-09-11: raised from 650 by two concurrent lanes landing together, each measured against
  // that same shared baseline without knowing about the other:
  // (a) host Task 25/26 Steps 9-11 (archived implementation record) —
  // assemble.ts's step 9 now wires the real, already-built managed ext host
  // (bindExtensionInvocations + createManagedExtHost + loadBundledExtensions) in place of the old
  // tools-only createExtHost, replacing one line with the ports construction, the shutdown
  // callback (a real judgment call, documented in the code), the native-import default for the raw
  // extension loader, and the two discovery mechanisms (specs built from
  // PackageModule.extensionEntry, plus loadBundledExtensions for package.json's
  // `agnes.extensions` bundles — @agnes/base's real tools ship through the latter, so leaving it
  // unwired would have silently stopped tool delivery). Measured alone: 690.
  // (b) host Task 24 Step 8 (same plan file) — packageDirs plus its builtinDir helper in
  // assemble/packages.ts, ~47 counted lines. The split-rather-than-raise warning above names
  // "package trust and lockfile verification" as the subject that must not grow here; that subject
  // landed separately under packages/ against the packages/host/src budget. Step 8 is the last step
  // of the sequence this key holds — with it landed the sequence is complete, there is no Step 9
  // that adds code to this directory beyond what (a) already accounts for. Measured alone: 686.
  // Combined, both landing on the same merge: measured total 744; 760 leaves a little room without
  // inviting scope creep back in.
  // 2026-09-11: the final I6 assembly wiring supplies ecosystem factories with the fitted sandbox
  // and operation factories with the resolved preset. Measured total: 780; 790 leaves ten lines.
  // 2026-09-11: T0.1 accounts for 2ec8411's runtime switch repair. Assembly exposes only the
  // reviewed built-in API-key routes it actually fitted, so the host can authorize a model switch
  // without treating arbitrary provider routes as declared. Measured total: 814; exact ceiling.
  // 2026-09-12: T6.3 adds the ephemeral opt-in and delegates selection to its own bounded module;
  // assemble retains only validation, service injection and the one discovery callback. Exact 853.
  // I7 Base35 wires consent overlay resolution and canonical session bindings. Exact 897.
  // The CLI SEA release path adds reviewed embedded-extension activation without creating a second
  // assembly route. Final embedded-manifest admission and package-entry containment: 906 exact.
  // P4/P5 add owner-bound projection reads; S3 adds one Service registry and bounded invocation wiring.
  // Service implementation stays outside assemble; R0 applies the effective isolation policy and hash; R1 adds verified inventory and bundled isolation admission; measured total is 1071.
  // H3 threads one shared activation barrier through assembly without moving barrier policy here.
  // S5 exposes the same invocation authority through call and trusted kind inspection; combined
  // assembly is 1082 after resolving the parallel activation/service lanes.
  // WIN-09b: measured Hook grant capability and assembly wiring. Measured 1185.
  // 2026-09-15 (EXTAPI-01 x main merge, PR #4): EXTAPI-01 Task 3's assemble.ts wiring (extensionPlatform
  // computed once, threaded into both the boot and hot-reload staging paths) landed independently of
  // WIN-09b above. Re-measured on the merged tree directly (never summed): 1188; exact cap, no spare.

  // resource-live-reload Task 3: reloadEcosystemExtension - buildEcosystemContext (extracted from

  // (re-derives the ExtensionSpec + directories loadBundledExtensions built, since nothing retains
  // them after assembly), makeFactorySelector (factored out of the inline selectExtensionFactory
  // literal so a reload can bind its own contextFor), and the Assembled type/return wiring. Exact

  // resource-live-reload Task 3b: re-measuring this key at the start of Task 3b (commit 646dbe45,

  // already red on arrival at 1289, 7 lines over the 1282 ceiling Task 3's own report claimed as
  // exact-zero-spare. Not attributable to this task - carried forward rather than hidden. Task 3b's
  // own addition is the `reloadableExtensions` line in assemble.ts's createManagedExtHost() call
  // (its accompanying explanatory comment is stripped by this guard's own countLines(), so only the
  // one code line counts): +1. Combined exact measured total: 1290, no spare.
  // resource-live-reload Task 8: `findBundledExtension` gains a second lookup path (embedded
  // manifests, matching the boot-time embeddedExtensions loop further down in assemble.ts) so a
  // packaged build (tools/build-local.ts's SEA) can find and reload `agnes/mcp-client` the same way
  // it is found at boot - previously it was only ever discoverable via the filesystem-scan path,
  // which a packaged build has no directories for, so reload always threw E_EXT_LOAD on a real
  // built worker.mjs (Task 7 confirmed this failed safely, not a crash, but never actually reloaded
  // anything). `reloadEcosystemExtension` routes the embedded case through `managed.loadEmbedded`
  // with the same fresh-resource-bound factory selector as the filesystem path, so the reload's
  // `freshInit` resources actually reach the extension factory (reusing boot's own
  // `selectExtensionFactory`, which is bound to boot-time `deps`, would have "succeeded" while
  // silently keeping stale resources). Fixes a real defect (a class of bug invisible to unit tests
  // by construction, since dev/test hosts always have real extension directories on disk), not
  // growth of an existing feature. Measured with the guard's own countLines(): 1317; exact cap, no
  // spare.
  // 2026-09-18 (resource-live-reload FINAL whole-branch review fix wave, finding I3): Task 8's new

  // CORDIS-C1 Task 3: ordinary preset/seam rows, required-owner audits, installed third-party

  // surface) and suppresses the assembly-time supply of the same id on both paths. The previous

  // 2026-09-21 extension rows stage 1 Task 3: row-backed ids become revokable per ID in

  // 2026-09-21 extension rows stage 1 Task 4: all eight ordinary builtin extension ids move onto

  // 2026-09-21 extension rows stage 1 Task 5: the Computer Use privileged input is keyed on the

  // 2026-09-21 extension rows stage 1 fix round 1: the Computer Use grant keeps an owner check

  // entry. Recounted after merging with the bug-hunt fix above; exact total: 4029.
  // 2026-09-17 CLI deep bug hunt M-02: a switch while this client's turn or queued prompts were pending
  // sent the queue and Ctrl-C's cancel to the next session. app.ts adds `refuseSwitch()`, called by
  // applySwitch (which now reports whether it switched) and by a session picker choice before it loads;
  // commands.ts calls it for /new, /rewind and /resume <id> before the daemon opens anything. Measured
  // with countLines() after the fix: 4038 (+9); exact cap.
  // 2026-09-17 CLI deep bug hunt M-05: /new, /resume <id>, the session picker and `@` completion read
  // process.cwd() instead of the launch --cwd. app.ts gains a `cwd` option (runTui passes io.cwd) and a
  // `cwd` getter that falls back to process.cwd(). Measured with countLines() after the fix: 4042 (+4);
  // exact cap.
  // 2026-09-17 CLI deep bug hunt M-09: `@` completion let readdirSync's EACCES/ENOENT escape the terminal
  // input callback, exiting in the alternate screen. completeToken catches it and offers no entries.
  // Measured with countLines() after the fix: 4048 (+6); exact cap.
  // 2026-09-17 CLI deep bug hunt M-10: a /new, /resume or picker answer landing after stop() still swapped
  // sessions and started a projection nobody stopped, whose retry timer kept the process alive. applySwitch
  // returns without switching once the app has stopped. Measured with countLines() after the fix: 4049
  // (+1); exact cap.
  // 2026-09-17 CLI deep bug hunt M-12: a resource slash command was classified as mutating by its first word,
  // but the parser takes flags before the action, so `/mcp --expected-revision <rev> trust srv` ran without
  // /mcp confirm. commands.ts now reads the action the way the parser does. Measured with countLines()

  // 2026-09-20 (DBH INV-004 + INV-002), 4094 -> 4100, measured with this guard's countLines():
  //   +3  TuiApp.runInput() collapses the editor's onSubmit routing and the argv-prompt entry
  //       onto one method owning the .catch(showError), so the contract no longer depends on
  //       each caller remembering it (new 4-line method, onSubmit loses 1 line).
  //   +2  waitForPackageOperation() bounds its poll loop and names the give-up reason, matching
  //       the sibling poller in resource-control-cli (constant + terminal throw).
  //   +1  flushQueuedPrompts() re-arms the queued-prompt wake path on every exit, so a prompt
  //       put back after a refusal cannot strand with no live retry route.
  // 2026-09-21 daemon UI demo closure: `/package` completes the pre-existing package-admin
  // contract in the TUI (lifecycle operations and durable operation lookup/cancel), while the
  // reconnect event makes recovery visible. Re-measured with countLines(): 4214; exact cap.
  // 2026-09-22 macOS E2E smoke (bug #2), 4231 -> 4265, measured with this guard's countLines():
  //   TuiApp now handles the SDK's terminal 'closed' event (daemon stop): stops the spinner through
  //   a resetTurn() shared with applySwitch, shows a localized `agnes --resume <id>` notice (new
  //   'notice.closed' key, 3 lines), and refuses input that would re-dial and run unseen. Review
  //   follow-up (+10): the close also cancels the queued-prompt wake and stops the projection, and
  //   one refuseClosed() guards runInput (normalized /quit), actions and both pickers. Second review
  //   follow-up (+4): approval and tool cards go inert after the close (a parked ticket would otherwise
  //   be decided on the restarted daemon), and the approval card's decide callback is guarded too.
  // 2026-09-22 CLI E2E: the /resume picker offered sessions bound to other workspaces, which daemon

  // 2026-09-10: raised again from 3320 by Task 21's core-logic slice (reclaim.ts -

  // `SupervisorRegistry` bridge that lets a `WorkerRegistry` satisfy `LocalContext.registry` without
  // widening that type across three already-landed files, the profile-only `Host` facade, and

  // report documents needing: `local/methods/acp.ts` gained the optional `onPromptStart`/
  // `onPromptEnd` context hooks `session/prompt` calls around its `inflight` window (this is how the
  // supervisor's `PrompterRouter.originOf` learns which of several concurrent connections owns a
  // session's live prompt - the in-process form never needed this because it only ever has one
  // connection), and `worker/main.ts` gained the optional `deps.buildHost` hook `runWorker` uses
  // instead of `createHost` when supplied (so `test/fake-worker-entry.ts` can run a real worker
  // against a `@agnes/host/testkit` fixture host without a real package loader) - both no-ops for

  // IH2/IH3b/IH4b/IH10 add the production worker activation coordinator, durable recovery and
  // catalog-backed admin service, integrated with main's durable fork lane. The leaf caps below
  // keep the aggregate increase reviewable.
  // Independent IH9 review adds durable turn-revision leases, restart-safe candidate cleanup,
  // cold-start Host activation and the post-await WorkerPool admission fence.
  // Final blank-context recovery review adds fail-stop, child-exit fencing, durable turn recovery,
  // worker-side bootstrap selection, and their narrow orchestration ports, integrated with main's
  // durable fork lane. Manual compaction binds the revision lease before its durable marker, and
  // cleanupPending transactions retry online without requiring a blocked follow-up mutation. The
  // retry lane closes before supervisor ownership is released. The final shutdown review splits
  // intake stop from the turn/assembly fence and waits child-exit recovery before releasing the
  // owner lock. Final acceptance also rebuilds the worker assembly from live desired/active/turn
  // references so uninstall cannot retain dead snapshot paths. Web-observed operation failures also
  // drain queued progress writes before their terminal record. Measured merged total: 16816; exact cap.

  // (coordinateSurfacesOnBoot, the plan's central decision -- Surface coordination on every daemon
  // boot, independent of coldStart) plus the supervisor.ts wiring that constructs the SurfaceController,
  // secrets/artifact resolvers, the mutable `deployment()` closure threaded through the `surfaces`
  // option Task 8 added to createInProcessActivationRuntime, and the unconditional
  // coordinateSurfacesOnBoot() call site itself. Measured fresh on this tree with the guard's own

  // 2026-09-16 (surface-boot-wiring Task 10, review fix): the `startupCleanup.push(() =>

  // 2026-09-16 (surface-boot-wiring Task 15, cross-process bridge): `createMountProxy` only ever ran

  // from `agnesd`, so a JS closure over `SurfaceController` cannot reach it. Adds new
  // `local/methods/surfaces.ts` (registerSurfaces: the `_agnes/v1/surfaces.mounts` RPC handler) plus
  // its two-line wiring into `supervisor.ts` (import + `registerSurfaces(ep, {snapshot: () =>

  // startProductionSupervisor's returned handles, and the now-unused createMountProxy/
  // IncomingMessage/ServerResponse imports) and adding the M4 unix-transport gate on

  // repeated notes on this exact key, e.g. the 2026-09-17 entries acknowledging unreconciled
  // `packages/daemon/src*` drift on main). Task 7 itself narrows `WorkerRegistry.retireForResourceSnapshot()`'s
  // caller: adds `retireSessions()` + a shared `markForResourceRetirement()` helper to registry.ts and
  // narrows `wireResourceSnapshotNotifications()`'s registry parameter type in supervisor.ts - mostly

  // 2026-09-16 (surface-boot-wiring final review fix wave): C1 wraps coordinateSurfacesOnBoot's body
  // in a try/catch (boot-coordination.ts) so a Surface boot failure degrades instead of aborting the
  // whole daemon. I5 replaces artifact-resolver.ts's Windows-broken string-prefix containment check
  // with the relative()-based idiom already used in local-runtime.ts/workspace.ts. M7 adds a
  // deployDir-containment check to deployment-policy.ts so a profile trusting its own root cannot
  // self-author its policy override. I3 extracts the shared mount-match predicate and
  // healthy-instance filter (mountMatches/isRoutableSurfaceInstance in types.ts; matchMount in
  // mount-proxy.ts) and retires the dead in-process surfaceMountProxy mechanism from mount-proxy.ts's
  // own doc comments. M2 makes mount-proxy.ts route upstream headers through surfaceSecurityHeaders()
  // (its \r\n\0 filter) instead of spreading them unfiltered, and wraps writeHead in a try/catch. M3
  // narrows createMountProxy's lookup() return type to {mount, host, port}. Measured with the guard's
  // own countLines(): 2364; exact cap, no spare.
  // 2026-09-16 (surface-boot-wiring final review fix wave, lint pass): `biome check`'s formatter
  // reflowed mount-proxy.ts's multi-clause `node:http` import onto six lines (its own organizeImports
  // fix reordered the specifiers, which pushed the line past the width that keeps an import inline)
  // -- +5 lines, no behavior change. Measured with the guard's own countLines() after `pnpm lint` was
  // clean: 2369; exact cap, no spare.
  // 2026-09-17 (Block B hot update, Task 2 / RC2): SurfaceController gains a per-instance,
  // generation-keyed lifecycle. controller.ts re-keys `records` from bare `sourceId` to
  // `sourceId:generation` (new `instanceKey`), adds the `nextGeneration`/`currentGeneration`/
  // `perSourceOperation` bookkeeping, extracts `spawnInstance` (shared by the cold-boot loop and the
  // new `startInstance`) and `stopOneRecord` (shared by the whole-controller `stopRecords` and the
  // new `stopInstance`), and adds the three new public methods plus `projectInstance`/
  // `discardRecord`/`allocateGeneration`/`guardSource`/`trackSourceOperation`/`forgetRecords`.
  // types.ts adds `generation`/`current` to SurfaceInstanceStatus, the three method signatures on
  // SurfaceController, and the `current` clause in isRoutableSurfaceInstance. Roughly a third of the
  // addition is doc comment explaining why each of the three new maps exists, which the invariants
  // here (monotonic generations, promote-before-stop sequencing owned by the caller) need stated at
  // the declaration. Measured with the guard's own countLines() after `biome check` was clean on
  // these files: 2492; exact cap, no spare.
  // 2026-09-17 (Block B hot update, Task 2 / RC2 review fix wave): +12 lines for two leak fixes in
  // controller.ts. `spawnInstance`'s post-health check splits its two conditions apart so the
  // "record left the table while this child was still starting" branch reaps the handle
  // (`forceStopHandle`) before throwing -- previously that branch dropped a live, healthy OS process
  // nothing could reach again, since `discardRecord` no-ops when the record is already gone. And
  // `discardRecord` now collects real failures instead of a throwaway array, keeping the record and
  // logging `surface instance cleanup did not complete` when TERM+KILL did not reap the child,
  // instead of silently deleting it. Measured with the guard's own countLines() after `biome check`
  // was clean on these files: 2504; exact cap, no spare.
  // 2026-09-17 (Block B hot update, Task 4 / RC5): boot-coordination.ts's pure "resolve, don't start"
  // half of `coordinateSurfacesOnBoot` is extracted into a new exported `resolveSurfaceDeployment`
  // function (deploy-dir -> policy -> resolveDeployment, no controller.start), which
  // `coordinateSurfacesOnBoot` now calls instead of inlining those same three steps -- so a hot update
  // (Task 5) can re-run exactly this resolution against fresh package-manager inventory instead of
  // reusing the boot-time snapshot. +9 net lines here (the new function plus its doc comment, minus the
  // three inlined lines it replaced in `coordinateSurfacesOnBoot`). Measured with the guard's own

  // T5.2 adds the isolated manifest-to-ToolContext permission projector plus its one-line execution
  // binding. This is incremental enforcement, not spare allocation. Measured total: 7203.
  // T6.2 adds only the bounded hooks-runner child connection and strict Seatbelt profile compiler;

  // within its existing ceiling. Combined measured Host source: 8753. The CLI SEA increment adds
  // reviewed embedded profiles/extensions plus boot-time lock integrity verification while keeping
  // the filesystem development path and the same preflight gates. Measured Host source: 8869;
  // exact cap.
  // Integration of unified configuration/session clients with upstream I8; exact merged count.
  // R1 verified inventory, generic Hook transport/entry, and awaited process supervision: measured total.
  // H3 adds the bounded activation barrier and wires turn/Tool/Service invocation ownership.
  // Review hardening lets only child work of an admitted invocation finish across the gate and

  // Main's durable fork wiring and activation-gated turn retention are integrated at this exact total.
  // paths.ts is the new single source of truth for the home/data/cache directory layout (AGNES_HOME

  // 2026-09-16 (remote-sandbox Stage A, Task 4): the new fs-io-remote.ts derives an FsIo purely from
  // a RemoteTransport - lstat/readdir/mkdir/rm as python3 -c one-liners printing structured answers
  // (parsing `ls -l` is a portability trap; a script printing exactly the fields wanted is not),
  // readlink as a plain command, upload/download for file content - so the fence in fs.ts runs
  // unmodified over a remote workspace. New file, +200 counted lines (this prefix's scan already
  // includes packages/host/src/adapters below, so the same increment is carried in both; six of the
  // lines are `pnpm lint`'s own formatting of two Object.assign(...) throws across multiple lines,
  // measured after that reformat, not before it). Measured total: 13053; exact cap, no spare.
  // 2026-09-16 (remote-sandbox Stage A, Task 6): openAdapters gained the RA17 remote-mode check (two
  // module-level constants, a small remoteTransportRoot validator, the agreement check itself), the
  // opts.preset option and its doc comment, transport threaded through AdapterBundle/close() and
  // SandboxHostServices/sandboxHostServices() - all new lines, no file added (this prefix's scan
  // already includes packages/host/src/adapters below, so the same increment is carried in both).
  // Measured total: 13097; exact cap, no spare.
  // 2026-09-16 (remote-sandbox Stage A, Task 8): the new remote-workspace.ts (openRemoteWorkspace -
  // makes one remote directory per assembly on open, removes it on close unless keepOnClose asked
  // otherwise) plus openAdapters wiring it into the remote branch (the remoteKeepOnClose config
  // reader, the openRemoteWorkspace call and its transport-closing catch, remoteWorkspaceRoot
  // threaded through AdapterBundle/close()) - new file, no file removed (this prefix's scan already
  // includes packages/host/src/adapters below, so the same increment is carried in both). Measured
  // total: 13142; exact cap, no spare.
  // 2026-09-16 (remote-sandbox Stage A, Task 8 fix round): review found close() awaited
  // remoteWorkspace.close() and transport.close() back to back, unguarded - a thrown/rejected
  // remote-workspace close (the rm -rf failing) skipped transport.close() entirely, which stays a
  // discarded boolean in Stage A's loopback double but becomes a leaked live connection once Stage B
  // fits a real transport. Wrapped the workspace close in try / the transport close in finally so the
  // channel always shuts down; no new file (this prefix's scan already includes
  // packages/host/src/adapters below, so the same +3 increment is carried in both). Measured total:
  // 13145; exact cap, no spare.
  // 2026-09-16 (remote-sandbox Stage A, final-review fix round): the whole-branch review found the
  // exec gate unwired for remote mode - the seam forwarded straight to the transport, so no request
  // ever met createPolicyExec's binding check or, decisively, its authorizeCwd, and the compiled
  // remote file policy applied to no exec at all. Fixed by giving the gate a remote `inner`, which
  // is what spec §4.6 asked for in the first place: the new exec-remote.ts (createRemoteExec - one
  // ExecAdapter over RemoteTransport.exec that hard-refuses a dead channel per RA7) plus openAdapters
  // choosing it for both policyExec and the factory's probe exec. Two smaller review findings land in
  // the same function: the open path now closes the transport on any throw between opening the
  // channel and returning (the mirror image of Task 8's close-path fix), and remote mode no longer
  // measures local filesystem facts for a remote workspace root (no local realpathSync, no local
  // case-sensitivity probe - an unmeasured remote volume is treated as case-sensitive, which is the
  // restrictive direction for the workspace allow rule). New file plus in-place wiring (this prefix's
  // scan already includes packages/host/src/adapters below, so the same +28 increment is carried in
  // both). Measured total: 13173; exact cap, no spare.
  // 2026-09-16 (remote-sandbox Stage A, second final-review fix round - exceptional, user-authorized):
  // the scoped re-review of the round above found three security-relevant gaps. `caseSensitive: true`
  // for an unmeasured remote volume was documented as restrictive and is not: the fence matched
  // `<root>/.GIT` against the workspace allow rule but not against the `.git` hard deny, admitting
  // the denied directory under another spelling, so remote mode now folds case (the fail-safe
  // direction, because folding widens deny matching too). And `createRemoteExec`, now the gate's
  // `inner`, applied none of `createExec`'s four safety defaults - so it gains the environment floor
  // that keeps AGNES_SECRET_* out of a remote command, the default deadline, the default output cap
  // (clamped on this side, not merely requested of the transport), and the abort-before-start refusal.
  // `createExec` keeps its behaviour byte for byte; three of its constants and its abort check are
  // simply exported so the remote runner matches rather than re-invents them. This prefix's scan
  // already includes packages/host/src/adapters below, so the same +28 increment is carried in both.
  // Measured total: 13201; exact cap, no spare.
  // 2026-09-16: hash session identity into title accounting IDs; measured 13595.
  // 2026-09-16 (merge with /yolo): a disableSessionTitle test escape hatch on HostOptions, so a
  // scripted-provider test asserting an exact call count for some other concern doesn't have to
  // spend a scripted response on the background title generation every session otherwise gets.
  // WIN-TITLE-REPAIR: +51 for trusted durable title-cost replay, cancellation, and stable identity.

  // forward here as well). Not attributable to this task. Task 3b's own addition is the narrow

  // `o.reloadableExtensions` construction line, and the two guard-site conditions it extends (net +8

  // 2026-09-09: raised from 1100. 1071 of it was spent and the 29 left could not cover the deny-list
  // repair with anything to spare; the repair measures 1075. The remaining 100 are platform-win32
  // reaching parity with platform-posix - today its probe() asserts a fixed table where posix
  // measures the volume, looks for a sandbox backend and reads the terminal, and posix spends ~100
  // lines doing so.
  // WHERE THE NEXT RAISE STOPS BEING A NUMBER: this key is eleven files answering four unrelated
  // questions, and two of them dominate - storage-sqlite.ts at 386 and the platform trio at 191.
  // The platform trio is also the part that grows by whole-OS increments, so one operating system's
  // completeness is charged against the fence layer's budget. Give platform its own key when the
  // win32 work starts, and storage its own if it passes ~450; what should be left under `adapters`
  // is the fs / exec / secrets / net fence and nothing else.
  //
  // 2026-09-11: raised from 1175 for the macOS ProcessIdentity backend (daemon's owner-lock crash-
  // recovery needs a live-PID probe on darwin, mirroring the existing process-identity-linux.ts).
  // Three new files: process-identity-macos.ts (42, the libproc-helper spawn/parse wrapper) and
  // process-identity-default.ts (12, the OS dispatcher picking linux/macos/unsupported off a
  // PlatformBackend's `os`, per the boundary test's ban on a raw platform check here) - 54 lines,
  // plus this key's existing files unchanged. Measured total: 1217; 1225 leaves a little room
  // without inviting scope creep back in. The compiled helper's C source
  // (packages/host/native/macos-process-identity.c) and its build script are outside src/ and do
  // not count against this budget.
  // 2026-09-11: raised from 1240 by base Task 14
  // (archived implementation record) — the fs/exec fence
  // itself grew, which is the content this key exists to hold: exec.ts gained createPolicyExec (the
  // spawn-time binding/digest/cwd/no-backend gate) and the revocable probeExec (~60 counted), and
  // adapters/index.ts gained the bootstrap-to-bound FsPolicy binding (bindFsPolicy with the
  // host-integrity floor check and deny-all poisoning, the dataFs/bootstrap policy builders, and
  // sandboxHostServices, ~110 counted). The split the note above names stays the next move, and is
  // unchanged by this: the process-identity trio (~110 counted) is not fs/exec/secrets/net fence
  // and belongs under its own key, but it is another lane's just-landed file set (daemon's
  // owner-lock crash recovery) and moving it from this lane would be churn on their files, so the
  // raise carries it for now. Re-measured after integration before finalizing this ceiling.
  // 2026-09-11: I9 Task 3 puts credential-files.ts and credential-store.ts in the adapters path
  // assigned by the execution plan. They are the secrets fence this key explicitly owns, not a
  // new unrelated adapter family. Measured adapter total: 2020; 2030 leaves ten lines.
  // 2026-09-12: T3.2 extends storage-sqlite with the ledger integrity sidecar only. Measured
  // adapter total: 2114; exact aggregate ceiling. The file crossed the ~450 split trigger above,

  // I7 Core40 adds only the fold-checkpoint methods to the storage adapters. Measured: 2165; exact.
