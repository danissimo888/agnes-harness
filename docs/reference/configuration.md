[Documentation](../README.md) · [First-time configuration](../guide/quickstart.md)

Find where settings live, which layer applies them, and which fields are managed by a service. For first-time model setup, use the [quickstart](../guide/quickstart.md) without reading every configuration field first.

Configuration files and model credentials are separate. Prefer CLI `config` or Web settings for providers. Do not write keys into YAML or manually edit a configuration-service revision.

## Locations and layers

| Location / variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `AGH_HOME` | Absolute home root, default `~/.agh`; relative paths are rejected |
| `AGNES_HOME` | Legacy compatibility variable with a deprecation warning; AGH_HOME takes precedence, with no automatic migration |
| `AGNES_PROFILE` / `--profile` | Profile selection, usually `local-dev` |
| `AGH_HOME/profiles/NAME/profile.yaml` | User profile layer |
| `AGH_HOME/profiles/NAME/configuration.json` | Accounts, default model, and references managed by the Host configuration service; not a manual configuration template |
| `PROJECT/.agh/profile.local.yaml` | Workspace overrides, subject to trust and permissions |
| `PROJECT/.agh/skills` / `PROJECT/.agh/hooks.json` | Workspace Skill and command-hook resources |
| `AGH_HOME/data`, `cache`, `secrets`, `auth` | Data, cache, credentials, and identity state |
| `AGNES_WEB_ORIGIN` | Exact Web Origin, for example `http://127.0.0.1:4180`, matching the serve port |

Built-in templates provide the base. User profiles and the Host configuration overlay are merged, then the workspace local layer is processed according to trust. Deployment and lockfiles also affect resolution. Configuration-service keys have their own user-layer override rules, rather than arbitrary YAML deep merging. Changing cwd alone does not select another daemon.

## Profile fields

| Field | Content and constraints |
| --- | --- |
| `name`, `schemaVersion`, `extends` | Identity, version, inheritance; current templates use schemaVersion 1 |
| `packages` | Sources, enablement, configuration; PackageManager still owns installation and trust |
| `seams` | Ownership of required seam implementations; not an unrestricted plugin registration API |
| `provider` | package/adapters/routes/catalog/contract; route name `default` is a reserved sentinel |
| `adapters` | storage/fs/exec/platform/secrets selection |
| `transports` | stdio/unix/ws-tls; remote configuration also needs certificates and authentication |
| `dataDir`, `cacheDir` | Data/cache locations; changes may alter shared-instance identity |
| `presets` | default and allowed; the default must be allowed |
| `approvals.mode` | manual/smart/off |
| `reconcile` | immediate/turn/step; maxWaitMs applies only to turn/step |
| `policy.capabilityCeiling` | Capability ceiling; excludes services by default |
| `policy.workspacePackages` | deny or require-project-trust |
| `computerUse` | Enablement, application access, capture, and retention limits |
| `extensionIsolation` | Isolation requests and unavailable behavior; declaration alone does not prove enforcement |
| `limits` | Supported dotted keys for daemon/worker/jobs/shutdown and other limits |

Check the full [profile schema](../../packages/protocol/schema/profile.json), [implementation types](../../packages/host/src/profile/types.ts), [local-dev template](../../packages/host/templates/local-dev.yaml), and [enterprise template](../../packages/host/templates/enterprise.yaml). Valid schema is only the first gate; policy and assembly can still refuse a configuration.

## Models and secrets

The configuration service supports account lists, per-account routes, and a default account. Routes may look like `account-...`. Select the route/model returned by the interface; do not assume all accounts for a provider share one route. Catalogs and contracts determine capabilities, and saving validates the selected model. New defaults do not rewrite existing sessions.

Credentials use `secret://namespace/name` references. File, environment, and vault adapters are different deployment options. Do not copy fake demo tokens into real services or expose real values in browser `publicConfig`, tool output, or environment dumps.

An exported [preset definition](../../packages/protocol/schema/preset.json) may set `model.max_tokens` to a positive safe integer, for example `model: { max_tokens: 32768 }`. This sets the primary model's per-request output allowance, independently of catalog capacity; omitting it preserves the provider default. Request hooks may override it, and tree budgets may lower it. Use a value supported by the selected provider. This field belongs to the preset definition, not the profile's `presets` selection or a top-level profile `model` field. Existing sessions retain their resolved preset.

For the official Agnes China gateway, the adapter explicitly sends the built-in models' catalog allowance of 65536 as `max_tokens` when no request override is present. Official specifications list 65536 for [3.0 Flash](https://agnes-ai.com/zh-Hans/docs/agnes-30-flash), [2.5 Pro](https://agnes-ai.com/zh-Hans/docs/agnes-25-pro), and [Pro Alpha](https://agnes-ai.com/zh-Hans/docs/agnes-25-pro-alpha). [Pro Beta](https://agnes-ai.com/en/docs/agnes-25-pro-beta) uses the Pro family allowance of 65536; its gateway capacity has not been independently verified. The [2.5 Flash](https://agnes-ai.com/zh-Hans/docs/agnes-25-flash) and [2.0 Flash](https://agnes-ai.com/zh-Hans/docs/agnes-20-flash) docs publish a rounded 65.5K, interpreted here as 65536. Deprecated models remain registered for configuration compatibility; gateway availability still applies. Explicit request allowances take precedence. Catalog metadata alone does not set the raw OpenAI-compatible stream's request allowance. Large generated files should still be built across multiple small write/edit calls; the default is an allowance, not a guarantee that an arbitrarily large call completes.

## Same-name Skill priority overrides

Default source priorities are workspace 500, runtime 450, AGH user 400, agents 300, claude 200, codex 100, and package 50. Users can set integer overrides from 50 to 500 for non-runtime candidates, or `null` to restore the source default. This data is stored by profile/resourceId in the resource-control journal and applied through worker control snapshots. It is not a new profile YAML field; do not edit the journal manually.

Saving compares content `expectedRevision` and current `expectedPriority`, without changing trust/desired. Name resolution selects a winner by priority, then evaluates its own authorization. Disabling a higher-priority item does not automatically activate a lower-priority one. See [Skills](../guide/skills.md#change-same-name-candidate-priority) and the [resource schema](../../packages/protocol/schema/resource-control.json).

## Plugin configuration has its own contract

Ordinary plugin defaults come from `agnes.plugins[].config` and are validated by the exported `Config`. Assembly interfaces handle deployment/user/workspace row overrides. Do not invent a top-level `plugins:` key that the parser does not support. See the [plugin tutorial](../develop/plugins.md) for package entry points, configuration, and inject/provide shapes.
