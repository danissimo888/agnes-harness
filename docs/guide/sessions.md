# Sessions and recovery: continue your work

[Documentation](../README.md) · [Security boundaries](security.md)

Work can continue across multiple terminal or browser visits. Use an explicit session ID to recover context, inspect execution records, and decide the next step.

A session contains task history, model selection, and execution state. A user request starts a run. CLI, Web, and SDK read the same backend facts, but a UI history projection is not a raw database backup.

## Find and resume a session

```sh
node packages/cli/dist/local/agnes.mjs sessions --json
node packages/cli/dist/local/agnes.mjs sessions show SESSION_ID
node packages/cli/dist/local/agnes.mjs resume SESSION_ID -p "Continue explaining the unfinished parts"
node packages/cli/dist/local/agnes.mjs -p --resume SESSION_ID "Continue our previous discussion"
node packages/cli/dist/local/agnes.mjs -p --continue "Continue"
```

`--continue` and `--resume` are mutually exclusive. Use an explicit ID when precision matters to avoid resuming an unintended recent session. Check working directory, model, and permissions separately for new and resumed sessions. Switching a Web workspace does not transfer existing sessions to a different daemon.

## Export and import

```sh
node packages/cli/dist/local/agnes.mjs export SESSION_ID --format agnes -o session.jsonl
node packages/cli/dist/local/agnes.mjs export SESSION_ID --format sharegpt -o training.json
node packages/cli/dist/local/agnes.mjs export SESSION_ID --html -o session.html
node packages/cli/dist/local/agnes.mjs import session.jsonl --from auto --key agnes:local:default:import:dm:docs-copy
```

The native import above uses a new session key. Choose a previously unused key for each trial. Omitting the key may point back to the original session; open or nonempty targets are rejected. Import is a one-shot path and does not support `--connect`. An imported session records its origin in its first event (`session/start` field `imported`: the source format, and for a native import the original session key); a Web diagnostics export of it carries an `imported` warning.

Exports may contain prompts, tool arguments, paths, and business data. Review them before sharing. `--raw` reduces privacy filtering and is not the default sharing method. Importing external formats such as Claude Code, Codex, or Pi converts data; it does not restore the original permissions or process, or guarantee lossless semantics. Preserve import errors and inspect the session list. Changing IDs and retrying is not a substitute for diagnosing a failure.

## Interruptions and restarts

A stop request, process exit, expired approval, and completed run are different events. Core recovers through persistent events and a state machine. Unknown side effects may require human confirmation. Recovery cannot guarantee exactly-once operations in external systems, and resending the same natural-language request is not a recovery protocol.

After a daemon failure, preserve the home and error, inspect `daemon status`, restart with the same profile, and check history before continuing. Do not delete SQLite, owner, or audit records to force a restart. Stop the relevant instance before backing up related data from its home. Copying a database file while it is being written is not a reliable backup.

TUI `/rewind SEQ` and Web forking create a new session from a historical point. They do not undo file writes, recall network requests, or invalidate completed tools. Recovery applies current permissions; past authorization is not revived automatically.

Implementation: [session SDK](../../packages/sdk/src/session.ts), [Core](../../packages/core/src), [import](../../packages/cli/src/commands/import.ts), [export](../../packages/cli/src/commands/export.ts).
